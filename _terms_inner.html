<p>in any applicable law (which may depend on where you are

<h2 id="cookies">Use of cookies</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">24</span> Cookies are short text
files stored in your web browser to allow us to remember you when
you return to our websites. When you access PDFTables by means
of a web browser, you consent to our using cookies to personally
identify you in order to improve your experience of our websites
and the functioning of PDFTables. You also consent to the
setting of Cookies by various third party services (see our
<a href="/cookies">cookie page</a> for details).</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes to terms and conditions</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">25</span> We will announce any
changes to these terms and conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="section-number">25.1</span> by our terms and
    conditions RSS feed at <a href=
    "https://pdftables.com/termsfeed.rss">https://pdftables.com/termsfeed.rss</a>;
  and</li>

  <li><span class="section-number">25.2</span> when you log in
    for the first time after the announcement</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="section-number">26</span> The announcement will
give a date on which the new terms will come into effect. Except
in situations forced on us by unexpected changes in the law, we
will always give at least one month's notice of any change.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">27</span> If you are using our
free pricing plan, your continued use of our services indicates
your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">28</span> If you are using any
other pricing plan and we have announced changes to our terms and
conditions, you may terminate your contract with us by giving us
notice in writing within 21 days of the date on which the
announcement was made. Under these circumstances, your right of
access to PDFTables will terminate on the date the new terms and
conditions come into force. You will not be entitled to a refund
in respect of any outstanding credit or other money paid to
us.</p>

<h2 id="termination">Termination</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">29</span> You may terminate your
use of PDFTables at any time by sending a message to <a href=
"mailto:hello@pdftables.com">hello@pdftables.com</a>. We will not
refund any outstanding credit to your account if you terminate it
in this way.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">30</span> We may terminate your use of PDFTables
by sending you notice in advance. We may send such a notice by email to
the last email you have registered with us. This agreement, and your use of PDFTables,
will end on the 32nd day after we have sent you the notice (counting
the day on which the notice was sent as the first day). This means that all
unspent credit on your account will be lost unless you spend it within the
notice period.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">31</span> There are unfortunately
circumstances, which we think will be extremely unlikely to
occur, where we may have to terminate your access - for example
where we have been ordered to do so by a competent authority and
we are not permitted to tell you why. For this reason, we reserve
the right to terminate your access to the service at any time
without the need to give you a reason, although we will try to
give one if possible. In the unlikely event that we terminate
your access in this way where you are not at fault, we will
refund any outstanding credit within 30 days if we are permitted
to do so.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">32</span> We also reserve the
right to terminate your access to the service at any time if you
are in breach of our Acceptable Use Policy. No refund will be
offered if your account is terminated for such a breach.</p>

<h2 id="ip">Intellectual property</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">33</span> Your use of PDFTables
does not grant us any additional <em>intellectual property</em>
rights in respect of your <em>content</em>, and the act of using
PDFTables to process data shall not grant us any additional
<em>intellectual property</em> rights over the output of that
processing.</p>

perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide licence to use

  available as part of the normal operation of the site</li>

caused.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">37</span> Similarly, while we may
in our absolute discretion decide to back up some or all of your

reason.</p>
