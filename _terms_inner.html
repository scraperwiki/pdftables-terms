(such as copyright infringement notices) or of any legal request
for a third party to have access to your <em>content</em>.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">16</span> We will not inform third
parties about your use of PDF Tables unless we are required to do
so by law or you have given us permission to do so. We may
monitor PDF Tables for duplication of activity by you and another

<p><span class="section-number">23</span> You will not use PDF

<p><span class="section-number">24</span> You will not use PDF
Tables to annoy, harass or cause a nuisance to anyone.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">25</span> You will respect our

<p>in any applicable law (which may depend on where you are

<p><span class="section-number">29</span> We reserve the right to

</p>


<h2 id="cookies">Use of cookies</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">30</span> Cookies are short text
files stored in your web browser to allow us to remember you when
you return to our websites. When you access PDF Tables by means
of a web browser, you consent to our using cookies to personally
identify you in order to improve your experience of our websites
and the functioning of PDF Tables. You also consent to the
setting of Cookies by various third party services (see our
<a href="/cookies">cookie page</a> for details).</p>


<h2 id="changes">Changes to terms and conditions</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">31</span> We will announce any changes 
to these terms and conditions by sending an email announcement to the 
email address associated with your account.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">32</span> The announcement will
give a date on which the new terms will come into effect. Except
in situations forced on us by unexpected changes in the law, we
will always give at least one month's notice of any change for users of the
<em>service</em> and new terms will not come into effect for downloadable
software until the beginning of the next licence period.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">33</span> If you are using our
free pricing plan, your continued use of our <em>products</em> indicates
your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">34</span> If you are using any
other pricing plan and we have announced changes to our terms and
conditions, you may terminate your contract with us by giving us
notice in writing within 21 days of the date on which the
announcement was made. Under these circumstances, your right of
access to the <em>service</em> and use of any <em>downloadable software</em>
will terminate on the date the new terms and conditions come into force. You
will not be entitled to a refund in respect of any outstanding credit or other
money paid to us.</p>


<h2 id="termination">Termination</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">35</span> You may terminate your
use of the <em>service</em> at any time by sending a message to <a href=
"mailto:hello@pdftables.com">hello@pdftables.com</a>. We will not
refund any outstanding credit to your account if you terminate it
in this way.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">36</span> We may terminate your use of 
<em>the service</em> by sending you notice in advance. We may send such a
notice by email to the last email you have registered with us. This agreement,
and your use of <em>the service</em>, will end on the 32nd day after we have
sent you the notice (counting the day on which the notice was sent as the first
day). This means that all unspent credit on your account will be lost unless
you spend it within the notice period.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">37</span> There are unfortunately
circumstances, which we think will be extremely unlikely to
occur, where we may have to terminate your access to the <em>service</em> - 
for example where we have been ordered to do so by a competent authority and we
are not permitted to tell you why. For this reason, we reserve the right to
terminate your access to the service at any time without the need to give you a
reason, although we will try to give one if possible. In the unlikely event
that we terminate your access in this way where you are not at fault, we will
refund any outstanding credit within 30 days if we are permitted to do so.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">38</span> We may also terminate this agreement
if you are in material breach of it. No refund will be offered if your account
is terminated for such a breach.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">39</span> If this agreement terminates, for
whatever reason, you will delete any copies of <em>downloadable software</em>
in your possession or control and any licence to use <em>downloadable
software</em> granted under this agreement will cease.</p>

<h2 id="ip">Intellectual property</h2>

<p><span class="section-number">40</span> Your use of the <em>service</em>

<em>intellectual property</em> rights over the output of that

<p><span class="section-number">44</span> Similarly, while we may
in our absolute discretion decide to back up some or all of your

<p><span class="section-number">45</span> If you are using

liability under <em>this agreement</em> shall be limited to the
total amount paid by you under <em>this agreement</em> in the six
years proceeding the time at which the liability arose.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">48</span> Regardless of whatever else it might
say in this agreement, nothing in this agreement is intended to exclude any
liability that the law would not permit us to exclude.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">52</span> No term of <em>this
agreement</em> is intended to be enforceable by anyone other than
one of <em>the parties</em>. In consequence, the Contract (Rights

<p><span class="section-number">53</span> If a court, or other
competent authority, finds that any term of <em>this
agreement</em> is illegal or otherwise unenforceable, that term
is to be treated as if it had been severed from <em>this
agreement</em>. Its severance will be treated (as far as
possible) as having no effect on the remainder of <em>this
agreement</em>.</p>

<p><span class="section-number">54</span> <em>The parties</em>
are not in, and do not intend to form, a partnership. Nothing in
<em>this agreement</em> should be construed to the contrary.</p>
